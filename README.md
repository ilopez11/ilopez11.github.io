## About Project
I was hired and given complete responsibility by the owners of this business to develop a personal website that could accurately represent the services and atmosphere created for their customers. 
My first goal was to find the color and layout of the entire site to provide a look that was an accurate representation of the business. Afterward, I made sure to organize all the visuals of the food, owners, and spaces so that
customers could easily find each section of information on every page. Then, I added further style and functionality to make sure everything operated smoothly and allowed customers to view all the information the owners wanted to provide.
