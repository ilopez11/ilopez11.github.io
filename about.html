          <p class="story">
            A family-owned business committed to serving authentic American/Mexican dishes and pies in a friendly and peaceful environment. This idea began with Alfonso and Maria López coming to the United States in 1986 following the American Dream. Both were raised in neighboring humble farms in Oaxaca, Mexico, before departing their homes, searching for a better life across the border.

            Alfonso spent several years working in orchards and at a cattle ranch upon arriving in the United States until he eventually pursued his dream to become an educator by obtaining a teaching degree. He would go on to begin his educational career at Lewis & Clark as a teacher and eventually became principal and is currently the Director of Hispanic/Latino Relations for the Wenatchee School District.

            Maria supported him with his endeavor by always tending to their three children, Julio, Mauricio, and Ivan. She would always remain busy working in the food industry, mainly in restaurants, as a waitress and cook at various businesses. She would eventually attend college to learn English and then obtain her GED diploma with a degree in accounting. However, throughout her many years of working in restaurants, Maria collected several recipes and popular dishes now served at her own restaurant since opening in 2016.
